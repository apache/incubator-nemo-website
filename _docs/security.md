### Reporting Security Issues
 
The Apache Software Foundation takes a very active stance in eliminating security problems and denial of service attacks against its products. We strongly           encourage folks to report such problems to our private security mailing list first, before disclosing them in a public forum.
 
 
Please note that the security mailing list should only be used for reporting undisclosed security vulnerabilities and managing the process of fixing such       vulnerabilities. We cannot accept regular bug reports or other queries at this address. All mail sent to this address that does not relate to an undisclosed      security problem in our source code will be ignored.
 
 
The private security mailing address is: [security@apache.org](mailto:security@apache.org). Please consult the [Apache Security guide](https://www.apache.org/security/).
